                    <p>I am a motivated student with passion for technology and design. I am currently focused on learning software development [iOS mainly] through self-directed learning. One of my major interests is photography and I recently bought a camera (Fuji X-T20), and I've been taking pictures non-stop ever since.</p>

                        <h2>Projects</h2>
                        <p>Everyday, I strive to learn something new. These are the projects that I've worked on either in school, at work, or usually just on my own time for fun. I think it's more interesting when you apply your knowledge to build something, especially when it solves a real-world problem.</p>

                            <h3>Personal Website</h3>
                            <p>This project was started in order to familiarize myself with basic web development using html and css to make static websites. All the source files for the website are hosted on GitHub. I plan on using it to showcase some of my photos and as a record of my projects and awards, as well as a challenge to teach myself something I was not taught in school.</p>

                            <h3>Location iOS App</h3>
                            <p>I built this app while completing an iOS tutorial from Udemy. I first built it in early 2016 with just a year of coding experience. The app is built with a TableView and a MapView with a NavigationViewController. The user can use the map to find significant locations and store them in the table for later viewing, as well as saving their current location [in CoreData].</p>
                            <p>This project was very good at teaching me how to create a [at the time] large project compared to my school assignments that never required more than 50 lines of code. I learned how to use callbacks, since the reverse geocoded was my first experience with asynchronous programming. I also learned how to change the colour scheme of an app within Xcode, as well how to implement some basic force touch functions.</p>
                            <p>The first product was very disorganized and very much 'hacked together'; this lead to many headaches and entire weeks figuring out bugs. After the summer of 2016  I got hired to work on a software development team (C#) for 12 months and learned a great deal about proper software development conventions, and how to organize very large files and code-bases. Nearing the end of my 12 months I decided it would be fun to rewrite/refactor the entire application, while also serving as a refresher for iOS development.</p>
                            <p>I spent two whole weeks after work on this project and in the end I saw that I have overcomplicated much of the logic and also expanded on this project by adding the colour scheme, icons, and force touch. I changed the data storage from NSUserDefaults to CoreData, which although did not simplify the app, it made it more scalable and allowed me to learn something new.</p>
                            <p>I am very proud of this app because it shows me how far I have come in just 2-3 years, as well as it showed me that I can overcome new challenges with enough perseverance.</p>

                            <p>This was a challenge for the Mobile Developer Intern at Shopify, where we had to parse a JSON containing all the products and variants offered by a super duper awesome store. The products are shown in a table with an image, product title, vendor name, and number of variants. The tableview loads dynamically as the data is parsed and the images are downloaded.</p>
                            <p>This was my first experience with JSON and also helpful at learning more how to use URLSession and asynchronous functions in swift. More information including the source code and notes on how I built this can be found on GitHub by clicking the button below.</p>

                            <p>In software development, oftentimes testing will take up a very significant amount when adding new features or improving the performance of the product, in order to ensure that old functionality is not broken with the code changes. This can be very costly for the company and can kill the momentum a team has since testing is both mundane and tedious. A thorough description of the project can be found on GitHub by clicking the button below.</p>
                            <p>In order to improve the regression cycles on my team I was tasked with designing and building an automated testing framework, under guidance of a QA developer. We used Selenium in order to interact with the browser since it was a web-based application. Gherkin was used to write the actual test cases so they could be implemented by team-members not familiar with C# or programming in general, since Gherkin is written in natural English. The framework was written in C# and run on Visual Studio, and was able to execute with 4 threads about 400 test cases in just over an hour; these same test cases run manually would have taken the team about a three days to complete.</p>
                            <p>I did not finish implementing all the test cases since three were too many and my coop terms there came to an end but the framework structure was in place and only had to be expanded to include mappings to the whole application.</p>
